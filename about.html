    <p> I'm a second-year master's student at the University of Michigan
        studying user experience design and research. I have a background
        in understanding human behavior, having studied cognitive science
        as an undergrad. I love problem-solving and working with others!</p>

    <p> I've been an avid tech fan since I was little, constantly reading
        about the newest tech products and tinkering with any software
        application that I found interesting. When Google released its
        first Material Design guidelines, I became enamored with design,
        and it became my mission to learn how to make attractive and usable designs!</p>
