        I'm a first-year master's student at the University of Michigan
         studying user experience design and research. I have a background
         in understanding human behavior, having studied cognitive science
         as an undergrad. I love problem-solving and working with others!

        I've been an avid tech fan since I was little, constantly reading
         about the newest tech products and tinkering with any software
          application that I found interesting. When Google released its
           first Material Design guidelines, I became enamored with design,
            and it became my mission to learn how to make attractive and usable designs!
